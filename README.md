# Bait programming language
## Building from Source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tiabeast/bait
cd bait
./make.sh
```

Now you should have Bait compiled to JS at `<path to repo>/bait.js`.

The compiler has to be used like `node ./bait.js examples/hello_world.bt`.

To update Bait to the latest commit, run `node ./bait.js up`.
